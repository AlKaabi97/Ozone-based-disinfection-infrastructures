# Ozone-Based-Disinfection


Itâ€™s crucial that we are able to sterilise large spaces in the long-term. Hospitals, government offices, critical infrastructure locations used by essential workers between shifts, and public spaces such as transportation zones all need sterilising. The challenge is not just conducting the sterilisation but reducing the time it takes to perform the disinfection.

Ozone-based cleaning that uses industrial ozone gas generators provides an effective solution. It can be deployed in hospital operating theatres and patient rooms to prevent infecting the next patients and medical staff. It also can be used effectively in public buses, trains and taxis, and all types of office and critical infrastructure spaces.

Technical approach
--------------------

By adopting a similar approach to the sanitisation of PPE with UV-Type C lights, Ozone-based infrastructures will be scaled up to sterilise larger spaces.
